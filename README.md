# Farming Bot for Sunflower Farmer
This repository includes a potatoðŸ¥” farming bot. I don't provide any support.

## How to Use

```shell
# install deps
yarn

# set your private keys
vim hardhat.config.ts 

# Step 1: Send MATIC and SFF to your farm wallet

# Step 2: Create farm
env WALLET=1 npx hardhat run scripts/createFarm.ts --network polygon

# Step 3: Earn without playing 
env WALLET=1 npx hardhat run scripts/harvest.ts --network polygon
```

## FAQ

### Why do you publish bot?
Sunflower Farmer is a funny blockchain game that reminds me of legacy browser games. But Play-To-Earn is awful. That's everything.
